# Gandalf for iOS 10.2+
DANGEROUS TWEAKS SHALL NOT PASS!



# How to contribute
- add a conflicting package-identifier to the conflicts.txt
- do not make a new line, this was the source of the problem using the script.
- every tweak name ends with a Comma (,), except the last, space between each.
- make sure the conflicts are in alphabetical order
- an exception to the rule: the conflicts.txt must have 2 lines (line break at the end). 
- create a pull request
- if release is behind use bash to compile (sh build.sh)


# Notes
- testing can be done with the "New Package" in my repo
